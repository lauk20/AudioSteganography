# AudioSteganography

**Team Name:** Konstant Koders

**Team Members:** Kenny Lau, David Chong

**Project Description:** Audio Steganography


## Development Log
### 12/15/21
**Kenny Lau:** Learned/explored necessary Python libraries in order to convert image to audio (PIL/Pillow and scipy). Tried to make the program (Spectro.py) that converts an image into an audio file. Better understanding of how the program is *supposed* to work. It seems to crash now because the list holding the samples is huge. Need to find a better method of appending samples to a WAV file (maybe one that doesn't store a lot of samples in memory).

### 12/14/21
**Kenny Lau:** Did research on how to write WAV files from a given frequency and volume (etc.) (Need to download something for Java, maybe need to look into another language.) Started working on image to spectrogram program in Python. Needed to learn how to handle/write WAV files in Python along with how to process images in Python. Spent ~1 hr on image to spectrogram with little success towards the end goal.

**David Chong:** Filled out Google forms and worked on creating slides to present project.  Researching how spectrogramming would work in Python, and other languages where it would be possible, little success so far.
